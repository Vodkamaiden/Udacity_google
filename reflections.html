<p><strong><h2>
You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. </h2>
<p><h2>Answer the following questions:</strong></h2></p>
  
<ol>
	
<strong><li class="ques"><h3>
What new skills have you learned?</strong></h3></li>
  <div>
I've learned several attributes and  have enjoyed getting practice with them through the different quizes and exercises.</div>
<strong><li class="ques"><h3>
What has been easy?</strong></h3></li>
 <div>html/css has been pretty easy so far</div>
<strong><li class="ques">
<h3>What has been difficult?</strong></h3></li>
  <div>Keeping it simple. When I follow the directions and only do what was just covered in the lessons, it's easy. Sublime has lots of shortcuts, and sometimes those autofill with something else, and I get off track looking into those attributes...</div>
<strong><li class="ques"><h3>
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?</strong></h3></li>
<div>

 The first project wasn't too difficult, mostly due to the references provided - the resources given have been a huge help in figuring out what I've done wrong... the Forums also have helped - some people have had similar problems, or have shared tips that helped prevent having the problem to begin with. Def love the forums too!</ol></div></p></div>
